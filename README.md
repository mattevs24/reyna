# reyna

A lightweight Python package for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using polygonal discontinuous Galerkin 
finite elements, providing a flexible and efficient way to approximate solutions to complex PDEs.

### Features

- Support for various polygonal element types (e.g., triangles, quadrilaterals, etc.)
- Easy-to-use API for mesh generation, assembly, and solving PDEs.
- High performance with optimized solvers for large-scale problems.
- Supports both linear and nonlinear equations.
- Extensible framework: easily integrate custom element types, solvers, or boundary conditions.

### Installation

You can install the package via pip. First, clone the repository and then install it using pip:

Install from PyPI (if available):
sh
Copy
Edit
pip install polygonal-finite-elements
Install from source:
sh
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/polygonal-finite-elements.git
cd polygonal-finite-elements
pip install .
Optional dependencies:
matplotlib: for visualizing meshes and solution fields.
scipy: for additional solvers and utilities.
Install optional dependencies with:

```shell
pip install reyna
```
Example Usage

Basic Example: Solving a Simple PDE
python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from polygonal_finite_elements import Mesh, Solver

## Create a simple 2D mesh (triangle-based)
mesh = Mesh.generate_2d_mesh(shape="triangle", num_elements=100)

## Define the PDE and boundary conditions
def pde_function(x, y):
    return np.sin(np.pi * x) * np.cos(np.pi * y)

boundary_conditions = {'Dirichlet': {'left': 0, 'right': 0}}

## Assemble the system matrix and load vector
assembler = mesh.assembler(pde_function)
A, b = assembler.assemble(boundary_conditions)

## Solve the system
solver = Solver()
solution = solver.solve(A, b)

## Visualize the solution
plt.tricontourf(mesh.nodes[:,0], mesh.nodes[:,1], mesh.elements, solution)
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
Mesh Generation
The package includes functions to create meshes for various element types:

'''{python}
Copy
Edit
mesh = Mesh.generate_2d_mesh(shape="quadrilateral", num_elements=50)
Solving a PDE
Once the mesh is generated, use the Solver class to solve the problem:

python
Copy
Edit
solver = Solver()
solution = solver.solve(A, b)
