# Contributing

##  If you'd like to contribute to reyna, here's some areas:

* Data visualisation is a lacking part of this project currently! Contributions to customisable data visualisation functions are needed.
* Despite being minimal-overhead, reyna needs to be fast. Optimisations are always welcome as long as they follow the general simplistic package ethos.
* Boundary conditions are limited in reyna to Dirichlet. Neumann or mixed boundary conditions are still to be implemented.

  
# General guidelines

* If you've discovered a bug - just open an issue and we'll make an effort to respond.
* If you have any questions about contributing or the library, you can open an issue, or directly talk to the author.
